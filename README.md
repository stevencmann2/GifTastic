# GifTastic

Using the Giphy API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs. This is an assignment for the UT Coding Bootcamp. 

## Overview

In this project, I was tasked with making a dynamic webpage that contains buttons, a search bar, and a blank section that will populate with gifs. Using the Giphy API, the user can click the premade buttons, or add their own in the search bar to poulate the page with still images. Once the page is populated, the user can then click these images to animate the gifs (clicking the images will change them from animated to still). This method was achieved using an AJAX call to the Giphy API. 


### Prerequisites

There is no need to install anything. A basic understand of what a Gif is may help. A Gif is a looping short video clip made popular on the internet.

## Technologies Used

* Javascript
* Jquery
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* API's 

## Problem Solving

One issue I had with this assignment was the overall syntax assosciated with calling and using API's. I was able to solve this issue through various web resources. This would later prove to be incredibly helpful in the weeks to come with the first project looming.
